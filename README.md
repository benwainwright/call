# Call

* Please note this project is very much in pre-alpha stage. Feel free to use it but I bear no responsibility for you doing so.

# Summary

Call allows you to quickly build API clis by building up a series of aliases and
templates. If you run the program with an api URL, it will:

- Create and save an alias for the domain
- Create and save an alias for the path, with named variable elements

Next time you run the program, you will be able to make the same request using
the alias rather than the full url, passing in the values of variable sections
using arguments or options
